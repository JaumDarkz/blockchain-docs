# Welcome to Blockchain

So we can start to understand, we have the Bitcoin, who use a descentralized network to make peer to peer (P2P) transactions.

In all cryptcurrencies we have a difficulty of calcs of the block. With this we can mine a limited max supply of crypto, giving a economy to make the crypto have a value.

## What differenciates Bitcoin to Ethereum

In BTC we have a simple crypto, a simple coin, who make transactions and it's done.

In ETH, we have a lot of possibilities with smart contract that we can make all we want with this. Smart Contracts run similar to a real hand contract, but runs with code automatizating this process, code who determines what we gonna make with the ethereum network.

And now we have a question, how we can make things with this smart contract out of the network? we have the oracles to bring real world data to off chain network in the blockchain.

Chainlink provide us this technology. to bring the real world data. Thats called **Hybrid Smart Contracts**.

## Smart Contracts and Blockchain Points

- Decentralized
We don't have a centralized organization who make decisions for us and we depend on this. We have a independet users decentralized blockchain network.

- Transparency
All that happens in blockchain is visible, the rules are visible.

- Speed
All in blockchain is efficient, primarily currencie transactions.

- Immutable
Blockchain can't be corrupted or changed, who bring us security.

- Remove Conterparty Risk
Not depends in a politic interest, bringing security again.

-Allow for Trust Minimized agreements.
Smart contracts bring us non confidence security, we write the smart contract and auto-runs pieces of instructions without a centralized intermediate.

- Hybrid Smart Contracts
We can bring external real life data to a blockchai smart contract who makes hybrid.


## DAOs

Daos are decentralized organizations, works like a normal organization in real world, having people interacting with each other.

## Wallets

Wallets are wah they name says, in blockchain, we have wallets like metamask, who needs a secret phrase so we can have acces to the wallet.
**Keep this phrase safe.**

In our wallet, we can create more than 1 account. This is why securing this phrase is so important.
In each account, we have a unique identifier, called address.

## Nets

In our wallet we have as default settedthe mainnet, we can use multiple nets, like testnets, to make tests with fake money.

## Block Explores 

Are appelations that allow us to see easily things that happens on the blockchain like transaction details.

## GAS

Gas is unit of computational measure. the more computation a transaction uses the more **GAS** you have te pay for.

Every transaction that happens on-chain pays a **GAS FEE** to node operators.

So...

- Gas: measure of computation use

- Gas price: how much it costs per unit of gas

- Gas limit: max amount of gas in a transaction

- Transaction fee: gas used x gas price

IE:
21,000 gas @ 1 GWEI (gas price) per gas = 21,000 GWEI

## Gas Priority

The more we pay to realize a transaction the more fast the transaction will be realized.

## How Blockchain works in low-level

- 256 Hash (SHA, keccak & etc): A unique fixed length string, meant to identify a piece of data. They are created by placing said data into a "hash function".

- Hash Algorithm: A function that computes data into a unique hash

- Mining: The process of finding the "solution" to the blockchain "problem".
In example. the "problem" was to find a hash that starts with four zeros.
Nodes get paid for mining blocks.

- Block: A list of transactions mined together.

- Decentralized: Having no single point of authority

- Nonce: A "number used once" to find the solution to the blockchain problem.
It's also used to define the transaction number for an account/address.

## Public Keys & Private Keys

- Public Key: Is derived from your private key. Anyone can "see" it, and use it to verify that a transaction came from you.

### Signing a transaction:

A "one way" process. Someone with a private key signs a transaction by their private key being hashed with their transaction data.

Anyone can then verify this new transaction hash with your public key.

## Some Concepts

- Node: A single instance in a decentralized network.

- Anyone can join the network.

- Blockchain are resilient. Are thousands and thousands of nodes running. The blockchain will persist with at least 1 node runing the system.

- Blockchain nodes keep lists of the transactions that occur.

## Consensus

Is the mecanism used to agree on the state of a blockchain

### Consensus Protocol:
- 1. Chain Selection
- 2. Sybil Resistance

Eth and BTC are Proof Of Work (at the time od recording) that follow Nakamoto Consensus.

#### Nakamoto Consensus

It's a combination of PoW (Proof of Work) and Longest Chain Rule (The more blocks) more confirmation, and more expensive computation

#### ETH 2.0 will be Proof of Stake Sharded Blockchain

#### PoW & PoS are sybil resistance mechanisms

#### The bigger the blockchain, the more secure

#### Consensus is how blockchain decide what the state of the chain is

#### Sharding and rollups are scalability solutions to layer 1

## Layer 1
Base layer blockchain implementation.

## Layer 2
Any application on top of a layer 2.


#### Only so many transactions can fit into a block (have the power to increase gas price)

#### Gas prices are how much it cost to perform executions on-chain

## Congratulations!

If you've gotten this far, probbably you have in your head at least minimally how a Blockchain works.
